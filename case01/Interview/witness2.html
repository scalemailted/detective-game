It couldn't be me, I was in the bathroom washing my hands when it must have happened. I am quite a germaphobe, so I was in there quite awhile really scrubbing my hands clean. I just had to because I touched the same door knob that Jon did to get into this house. Nevermind that it was hours between, germs don't care about time.
