I wasn't feeling well and was sleeping in the bedroom. I woke up to get some water to take my pills, since I can take them every 8 hours, and I knew I needed more. I went into the living room to get to the kitchen when I found billy bayou dead on the floor. There was no one else in the room. But it couldn't have been me because I was alseep when this must have happened!
