				You solved the case. Lily stated that she couldn't be the murderer because she was too busy boiling eggs for the chef salad. However, the eggs were raw, not boiled. So she was lying about boiling the eggs, meaning she had the opportunity to kill Billy Bayou. She could have grabbed the garden spade from outside and snuck in from the backdoor to suprise attack him. She avoided getting prints on the shovel by wearing oven mitts.
